    /**
     * The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
     * Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
     * 
     * Example: 
     * Input n = 4
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown below.
     *
     * [
     *   [".Q..",  // Solution 1
     *    "...Q",
     *    "Q...",
     *    "..Q."],
     *   ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
     *    "Q...",
     *    "...Q",
     *    ".Q.."
     *    ]
     * ]
     * 
     * Constraints:
     * 1. 1 <= n <= 9
     * 2. You may assume that n is a positive integer.
     *
     * @param n - The size of the chessboard and the number of queens to place.
     * @returns int - The number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
